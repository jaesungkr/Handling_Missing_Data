A description on how Task-1 and Task-2 are done.

Some major steps are written

Data pre-processing:
1. import dataset and separate into 3 sheets CHILA TEMPERATURE and TOTAL P
2. Change name of depth to lowercase on Temperature sheet
3. put np.nan to both depths and targeted items on missing months (Not selecting specific depth level.)
4. Get mean of both depths and items (Chla, Temperature, Total p) on each month. 
(Later, Set depths to 0 after realized it's not useful)

Mean imputation:
1. set date by using pandas datetime function
2. pass it into getValue and getDepth functions (though Depth would not be used in future)
3. In getValue function, we get median of value on closest months ( if month is May or Oct, use 2 predates or 2 postdatess)
4. impute differently on different months
5. same processes with Temperature and Total P
6. save into excel file

KNN imputation
1. transform the input data into a right border
2. it automatically imputes the number 
3. save into excel file

Correlation
1. import 5 methods libraries
2. when inputing x for each method, input columns of three targeted items
3. extract results of 'correlation of temperature to CHILA' and ' correlation of Total P to Chila'
4. sort results by ranking
5. save into excel file
